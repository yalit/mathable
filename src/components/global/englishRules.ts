Mathable is a game based upon mathematical equations which must be formed on the playing board, described as being like playing Scrabble but using numbers. The game challenges players to use basic math equations including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to achieve the highest score.

## Components
- A playing board with normal squares, squares with a restriction (pink squares) and squares with an award (blue-grey squares marked 2X, and white squares marked 3X), and 126 numbered tokens
- 108 wooden tiles, 4 tile racks, a deluxe tile bag

## Setup
1. Each player takes a token holder which he places in front of him, so that no other player can see the tokens
2. The tokens are placed face-down on the table and are mixed well
3. Each player takes and keeps a token to see who is to start. The player with the highest number takes 6 more tokens to make a total of 7. Moving clockwise, the other players do the same

## How to Play

### Mathematical Equations
A mathematical equation is completed by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing two adjacent numbers putting a token with the result on the next empty square, be it to the right or left, below or above the two original tokens. Equations may be made horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally.

### Scoring
- Each token has a point value equal to the number on the token
- The total amount of points earned per turn is the total sum of the value of all tokens placed in that turn

### Special Squares

**Restriction Squares (Pink):**
The pink squares are marked with an addition, subtraction, multiplication or division sign, and oblige the player to form an equation of that particular nature, should he wish to occupy said square. If a player places a token on a pink restriction square, he may at that moment take an extra token if he so wishes.

**Award Squares:**
A grey square marked 2X doubles the amount of points of the token on that square, a white square marked 3X triples the amount of points.

### Multiple Equations Bonus
If a token, when being placed, completes more than one equation, and the player is aware of this, the points are gained for each equation completed.

### Extra Bonus
If a player manages to place all the tokens he has on his holder in one turn, he earns an extra bonus of 50 points (only applies if starting the turn with 7 tokens).

## Additional Rules
1. A player may make use of his turn to exchange one or more tokens on his holder for new ones
2. After having placed a token on the board, one may not take it back
3. A player may correct an opposing player's mistake, as long as he does so before the next player has taken his turn
4. At the end of his turn, each player takes tokens randomly from the pile, to bring the amount on his holder back to 7

## End Game
The game continues until there are no tokens left in the pile, and one of the players has used up all the tokens on his holder, or until no more equations can be made. At the end of the game, each player deducts the value of the tokens still on his holder from the total amount of points accumulated during the game.

The player who at the end of the game has obtained most points is proclaimed winner.

The game combines mathematical skill with strategic thinking, making it both educational and entertaining for players who enjoy number-based puzzles!
